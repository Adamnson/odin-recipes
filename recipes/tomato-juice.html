      <h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>
      <ol id="steps">
        <li class="section">Take your tomatoes and add them to a
          utensil.</li>
        <li class="section">Fill the utensil with water to completely
          submerge the tomatoes.</li>
        <li class="section">Boil the water with the tomatoes for 
          10-15 minutes.</li>
        <li class="section">After boiling the tomatoes, drain the hot
          water out and cool the tomatoes. You can do this by:</li>
        <li class="section">
          Add cold water to the tomatoes in the utensil and let
            them cool down for about 10 minutes. You could also place 
            the tomatoes on an empty plate instead, and let them cool.</li>
        </ul>
        <li class="section">Once the tomatoes are around room temperature,
          you need to peel the skin off of the tomatoes. The skin should 
          peel off easily if you have boild and subsequently coold them.</li>
        <li class="section">This is an optional step. You can cut the 
          tomatoes in half and scoop out the seeds. You can skip this 
          step and use the tomatoes with the seeds as well. Do note that
          leaving the seeds in could attribute a slight bitter taste to
          your juice.</li>
        <li class="section">Next, blend the tomatoes together with a 
          pinch of salt. You can use a juice belender or  mixer 
          grinder for this.</li>
        <li class="section">Et voila! Your godawesome tomato juice is
          ready to pour and serve!</li>
