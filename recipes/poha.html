  <img id="poha" src="../images/kanda-batata-poha.jpg" alt="Kanda Batata Poha with Sev.">
  <p id="description">Poha or Pohe or Kanda Pohe as it may be called, is a simple to make and high in contentment food. Making Poha is simple and it takes harly 15 minutes to <br>
  prepare. There are many optional ingredients involved and I have listed <em>(optional)</em> beside them. You can skip a couple of these but I would recommened <br>
  try the recipe with and without the optional ingredients and settle into your own unique style! Let's begin!</p>
  <h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Flattened rice or poha</li>
    <li>Mustard seeds</li>
    <li>Toor Dal or Split pigeon peas</li>
    <li>Onion 1-2 Nos</li>
    <li>Green chillies 1-2 Nos</li>
    <li>Turmeric powder</li>
    <li>Garam Masala</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Oil 10-15ml</li>
    <li>Groundnuts - a handful</li>
    <li>Lemon</li>
    <li>Potato 1 No <em>(optional)</em></li>
    <li>Green peas <em>(optional)</em></li>
    <li>Sev <em>(optional)</em></li>
    <li>Corriander leaves <em>(optional)</em></li>
    <li>Tomatoes <em>(optional)</em></li>
  </ol>
  <h2 id="steps"></h2>
  <ol id="steps">
    <li>Take the flattened rice in a collander and rinse it under tap water. Clean the flattened rice well and set it aside for a while. This lets the rice soak in some<br>
    water and become a little soft.</li>
    <li>You need to slice an onion. You can dice it into small pieces or leave them as thin and long stips.</li>
    <li>Cut the chillies into smaller pieces.</li>
    <li>Dice the potatoes. You need to keep them big enough for you to enjoy them in the Poha but small enough for the potatoes to cook completely without buring the oil.</li>
    <li>With the veggies chopped and ready, the next step is to take a utensil which is preferrabley curved as shown in the image.</li>
    <li>Place your utensil on the stove  and heat some oil in it. We dont need a lot of oil to make Poha. Just about 10-15ml should be sufficient.</li>
    <li>You need to check how hot the oil is before adding the mustard seeds. You do this by adding a few seeds to the oil. If they pop as soon as they are in the oil,<br>
    you can add the rest of the mustard seeds.</li>
    <li>Once the mustard seeds have stopped popping, you can add the toor dal. You can fry them till they acquire a light brown color.</li>
    <li>At this stage I go ahead and add the green chillies. Some people prefer to do it after the onions.</li>
    <li>Next into the utensil would be the onions. You saute them till you get a light golden color.</li>
    <li>Then you can add the turmeric power and the garam masala. The salt goes in at this stage as well. You can add a little extra salt at this stage if you plan on<br>
    adding potatoes to the mix.</li>
    <li>Now you add the groundnuts. If you want to add potatoes, you should add the groundnuts after the potatoes are cooked or when they are nearly cooked. The two things<br>
    that can absolutely ruin a good poha are <em>undercooked potatoes</em> and <em>burnt groundnuts</em>. You can also add the green peas at this stage.</li>
    <li>And now its time for the main ingredient - the poha itself. Add the flattened rice to the mix. Make sure you mix the contents well. You will most definitely need to <br>
    hold the utensil while you carefully mix the contents. Keeping the stove on low flame or simmer is recommened. As you mix, you will see the white rice take on the yellow <br>
    color from your preparation. You can swith off the stove as the cooking is almost done.</li>
    <li>The Poha is almost ready. You can add some cut corianeder leaves, tomatoes to the poha. This is the stage where you squeeze the lemon over the poha and mix it all once <br>
    again to get a uniform taste.</li>
    <li>Your poha is ready to plate! You may sprinkle some sev or bhujia over the poha and relish your delicious poha!</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure that the potatoes get cooked thoroughly. You don't want crispy-on-the-outside-raw-on-the-inside-potatoes in you poha.</li>
    <li>Don't leave the oil on high flame for too long. You don't want to burn your oil and have charred onions and chillies. Well, charred chilleies are fine, depends on your preference.</li>
    <li>I like my poha to look colorful - the yellow dotted with green peas, brown goundnuts and toor dal, red tomatoes dotting, light brown potatoes and green coriander on top with <br>
    bright yello sev on top. However, the potatoes, peas, tomaotes can be left out as well. Be mindful that leaving out a lot of the ingredients will leave you with a very <em>basic</em> poha.</li>
