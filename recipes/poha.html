    <p id="description">Poha or Pohe or Kanda Pohe as it may be called,
      is a simple to make and high in contentment food. Making Poha is
      simple and it takes harly 15 minutes to prepare. There are 
      many optional ingredients involved and I have listed <em>(optional)</em>
      beside them. You can skip a couple of these but I would recommened
      try the recipe with and without the optional ingredients and settle 
      into your own unique style! Let's begin!</p>

      <h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>
      <ol id="steps">
        <li class="section">Take the flattened rice in a collander and
          rinse it under tap water. Clean the flattened rice well and
          set it aside for a while. This lets the rice soak in some
          water and become a little soft.</li>
        <li class="section">You need to slice an onion. You can dice it
          into small pieces or leave them as thin and long stips.</li>
        <li class="section">Cut the chillies into smaller pieces.</li>
        <li class="section">Dice the potatoes. You need to keep them 
          big enough for you to enjoy them in the Poha but small enough
          for the potatoes to cook completely without buring the oil.</li>
        <li class="section">With the veggies chopped and ready, the 
          next step is to take a utensil which is preferrabley curved 
          as shown in the image.</li>
        <li class="section">Place your utensil on the stove  and heat 
          some oil in it. We dont need a lot of oil to make Poha. 
          Just about 10-15ml should be sufficient.</li>
        <li class="section">You need to check how hot the oil is 
          before adding the mustard seeds. You do this by adding 
          a few seeds to the oil. If they pop as soon as they are 
          in the oil,<br>
        you can add the rest of the mustard seeds.</li>
        <li class="section">Once the mustard seeds have stopped 
          popping, you can add the toor dal. You can fry them till 
          they acquire a light brown color.</li>
        <li class="section">At this stage I go ahead and add the 
          green chillies. Some people prefer to do it after the onions.</li>
        <li class="section">Next into the utensil would be the onions.
          You saute them till you get a light golden color.</li>
        <li class="section">Then you can add the turmeric powder and
          the garam masala. The salt goes in at this stage as well.
          You can add a little extra salt at this stage if you plan on 
          adding potatoes to the mix.</li>
        <li class="section">Now you add the groundnuts. If you want to
          add potatoes, you should add the groundnuts after the potatoes
          are cooked or when they are nearly cooked. The two things that
          can absolutely ruin a good poha are <em>undercooked potatoes</em>
          and <em>burnt groundnuts</em>. You can also add the green 
          peas at this stage.</li>
        <li class="section">And now its time for the main ingredient -
          the poha itself. Add the flattened rice to the mix. Make sure
          you mix the contents well. You will most definitely need to 
          hold the utensil while you carefully mix the contents. 
          Keeping the stove on low flame or simmer is recommened. 
          As you mix, you will see the white rice take on the yellow 
          color from your preparation. You can swith off the stove as
          the cooking is almost done.</li>
        <li class="section">The Poha is almost ready. You can add some
          cut corianeder leaves, tomatoes to the poha. This is the stage
          where you squeeze the lemon over the poha and mix it all once
          again to get a uniform taste.</li>
        <li class="section">Your poha is ready to plate! You may sprinkle
          some sev or bhujia over the poha and relish your delicious poha!</li>
      </ol>
      <h2 id="steps">Notes</h2>
      <ul id="steps">
        <li>Ensure that the potatoes get cooked thoroughly. You don't 
          want crispy-on-the-outside-raw-on-the-inside-potatoes in your
          poha.</li>
        <li>Don't leave the oil on high flame for too long. You don't
          want to burn your oil and have charred onions and chillies. 
          Well, charred chilleies are fine, depends on your preference.</li>
        <li>I like my poha to look colorful - the yellow dotted with
          green peas, brown goundnuts and toor dal, red tomatoes dotting,
          light brown potatoes and green coriander on top with bright 
          yellow sev on top. However, the potatoes, peas, tomaotes can be
          left out as well. Be mindful that leaving out a lot of the 
          ingredients will leave you with a very <em>basic</em> poha.</li>
